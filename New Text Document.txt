Project Idea: AI-Powered Code Review Assistant
A Django + React web app that uses Llama 3 to analyze and review code, providing feedback on best practices, optimizations, and security flaws.

Project Plan
1. Backend (Django)
Expose REST API endpoints to receive code snippets from the frontend.
Use Llama 3 API to analyze the submitted code and return feedback.
Store previous reviews and allow users to compare versions.
2. Frontend (React)
Simple code editor (like Monaco or CodeMirror).
Button to submit code and receive AI-generated feedback.
Display AI's analysis in a structured way (errors, optimizations, security issues).
3. Llama 3 Integration
Use Llama 3 to process code and provide insights.
Train a custom prompt template to ensure reliable and structured responses.
4. Deployment & Showcase
Backend: Deploy Django API on Render, Railway, or AWS.
Frontend: Deploy React app on Vercel or Netlify.
Demo Video: Show how a user submits code and receives feedback.
